# Coding-Principals

Here We will explain our best way of coding. Contributors should write/fix the codes according to these principles, code reviewers should known these principles.

### documentation

All parts of this document should be update if needed or changed principals.

All codes has unknown behaviors should be documented by (jsdoc, inline comments or swagger summery in backend apis)

### Tests

We have three type of tests which all of them should pass before of merging to develope
1- `$ yarn lint-commit` will be test syntax of code by defined rules in eslintrc
2- `$ yarn test` run all of \*.test.ts files and all of them should be as expected (if you have problem get help from developer of that test or other developers) **Don't change Test until you don't know what is that**
3- `$ yarn compile` test code types this is important (Avoid using any or ts-ignore)
